# A neural network in BlitzMax

Examples include:
 - Single-neuron "network" (Example1.bmx)
 - One layer and one output network (Example2.bmx, Example3.bmx)

Was inspired by Python neural network tutorials from medium.com (Mentioned in Example1.bmx and Example2.bmx).
You probably can build true multi-layered networks with this. Probably. I didn't test.

Publishing before I forgot about it because this may actually be useful to someone.

__P.S. You would probably be better off using [GenANN](https://github.com/codeplea/genann/)__
